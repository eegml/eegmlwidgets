# Useful widgets for the eegml lab

- CsvGridWidget: view and edit a csv file using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) and [qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid)
  - this requires that ipywidgets and qgrid are properly installed both in the environment serving the jupyter notebook (or jupyter lab) and in the kernel being used
  
### Installation
- as with many jupyter widgets, installatio can be tricky
- it is easier to get this working with the older jupyter notebooke because of its reduced security
- it can work with jupyter lab notebooks

see INSTALL.md for basic instructions on installation

### Examples
- see the examples/csvtest.ipynb
